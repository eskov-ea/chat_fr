  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.
  flutter_lints: ^1.0.0

# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/images/DV-rybak-logo-cropped.png
   - assets/images/no_avatar.png
   - assets/images/mute.png
   - assets/images/message_icon.png
   - assets/images/speaker_icon.png
   - assets/images/decline_icon.png
   - assets/images/accept_icon.png
   - assets/images/chat_background.jpg
   - assets/PDF_file_icon.png
   - assets/audio_icon.png
   - assets/image_icon.png
   - assets/image_icon_2.png
   - assets/file_icon.png
   - assets/file_icon_2.png
   - assets/download_icon.png
   - assets/blured_img_icon.jpg
#   - assets/mock_data/messages.json
#   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
#   - assets/ff-16b-2c-44100hz.aac

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
